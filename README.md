# Climate Change: United States vs. Greenland

### Summary
The goal of this project is to show the difference in warming trends between the United States and Greenland.  In the United States temperature increases haven't been easily perceivable -- potentially a reason for the lack of urgency on the issue.  However, temperature increases in Greenland have been more drastic over the last 25 year or so.  What's more, rising temperatures in Greenland are even more alarming due to the polar ice caps melting and causing sea level rise and several other issues.
